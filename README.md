# LumiDrugs Plugin

LumiDrugs Plugin is a heavily expanded survival/PvP gameplay system built around **powerful consumables**, **tolerance**, **addiction**, **withdrawal**, **overdose risk**, **cures**, **cannabis strains**, **bong/cart durability**, and **player achievements**.

---

## What’s New / Current Feature Set

Compared to a basic consumable-effects plugin, this version includes:

- Persistent, drug-specific tolerance and addiction tracking.
- Configurable overdose behavior (global, per-drug, staged, and random modes).
- Recovery systems (Suboxone, CBD, sleep-based cure logic, enchanted golden apple).
- Cannabis-focused systems:
  - Large strain registry with rarity and mutation weighting.
  - Plant growth timing controls.
  - `/strains` GUI index.
- Bong support:
  - Craftable bong item.
  - Configurable cooldown.
  - Configurable durability/uses.
- Cart durability/uses mechanic.
- Native Minecraft advancements + configurable triggers.
- PlaceholderAPI expansion for tolerance/effectiveness placeholders.
- Admin tooling for reloading configs, purging player data, listing drugs, and resetting overdose counters.
- Villager Farm Workers (Farm Controller automation with worker villagers).
- Hallucinogen drugs: LSD (a client-side nether-portal trip + nausea) and Salvia (a dirt-block disguise).
---

## Quick Start (Server Admin)

1. Build or download the plugin JAR.
2. Put the JAR in `plugins/`.
3. Start the server once to generate config files.
4. (Recommended) Install `FlyironDrugv1.3.1RP.zip` for custom textures.
5. Review generated config files and adjust balance if needed.
6. Use `/drugs reload` after config edits.

Plugin enable initializes one phase per server tick; commands show an initializing message until services are ready. Console logs name startup/shutdown phases and warn when a phase exceeds 50 ms. PlugMan still performs synchronous plugin unloading, class loading and final data saves, so a hot reload may pause ticks; use these timing logs and a watchdog thread dump to identify any remaining long pause.

---

## How to Use the Plugin (Gameplay + Admin Guide)

## Player Flow

1. Craft or receive a drug item.
2. Consume it to gain short-term buffs and tradeoff effects.
3. Repeated use increases tolerance; potency drops over time.
4. Continued use can cause addiction.
5. If addicted, withdrawal effects begin after the configured delay.
6. Recover with the matching cure, sleep (for configured stimulants), or golden apple reset.
7. Track your status with `/tolerance`.
8. Browse cannabis strain info with `/strains`.
9. Automate drug crop farms with Farm Controllers and worker villagers.
10. Track progression through `/drugs achievements`.


## Admin Flow

1. Give test items (including `farm-controller`) with `/drugs give`.
2. Validate config edits with `/drugs reload`.
3. Audit loaded drugs with `/drugs list`.
4. Reset problem accounts with `/drugs purge <player>`.
5. Reload overdose settings independently with `/drugs overdose reload`.
6. Clear overdose counters only with `/drugs overdose reset <player>`.

---

Each drug profile is fully configurable in `config.yml` (material, display name, lore, potion effects).

---

## Recovery / Cure System

Defined in `addiction.yml` and craftable through `recipes.yml` where enabled:

- **Suboxone**: cures configured opioid-related addictions.
- **CBD**: cannabis-focused cure behavior.
- **Sleep**: configured as cure logic for selected drugs.
- **Enchanted Golden Apple**: full addiction reset behavior.

Withdrawal behavior (effect types, timings, point decay) is per-drug and configurable.

---

## Cannabis Systems

- `strains.yml` ships with an extensive strain tree, rarity, and mutation weights.
- `growing.yml` controls fixed active growth times for cannabis and all ingredient crops.
- `bong.yml` controls bong enable state, base-drug behavior, cooldown, and bong item settings.
- `mechanics.yml` also controls cart and bong durability uses.

---

## Villager Farm Workers

Automated drug crop farming is available through Farm Controllers:

- Craft/place a **Farm Controller (barrel)** and right-click it to open its management dialog.
- Define farm region using a selection wand (max region size: **16x16**).
- Start/Stop the farm from the controller dialog.
- Purchase work contracts with emeralds and assign up to **5 villagers** by holding a contract in your main hand and right-clicking a villager. Each contract is already linked to its farm; you do not need to look at the controller.
- Assigned villagers are set to **Farmer** profession and must be reachable to contribute output.
- Workers harvest mature cannabis, poppy, mushroom, ephedra, coca, sassafras, ergot, salvia, and resin crops. Plant the initial crops yourself; workers reuse harvested seeds within each cycle. All crops, including cannabis, need hydrated farmland and light level 9+ to grow. Use **Set Output Chest** in the controller dialog, then right-click a chest, to store harvests and unused seeds (double chests supported). **Clear Output Chest** restores drops at the controller. Overflow or output for a missing/unloaded chest drops at the controller. The chest link survives restarts and remains at the same location when moving the controller. Vanilla wheat is left untouched.
- New controllers are barrels; existing composter controllers remain usable. Breaking a controller drops a barrel item containing its farm ID, area, worker links, and start/stop setting. Workers that cannot be found as living, valid villagers when the controller is placed again are removed (including workers in unloaded chunks). The farm pauses until placed again; its area moves by the same offset as the controller. Contracts remain valid while packed. Packed farms survive server restarts. Contracts for genuinely missing farms are exchanged for one emerald each when the player joins or an invalid contract is used.
- Dead/invalid villagers are removed from farm assignment data automatically.

Worker throughput scales by reachable workers per cycle (1 to 5 workers), based on `mechanics.yml` farm settings.

---

## Overdose System

`overdose.yml` supports:

- Global enable/disable.
- Attempt threshold.
- Per-drug vs global tracking mode.
- Attempt expiry windows.
- Broadcast toggles.
- Default fallback effects.
- Drug-specific overrides.
- Optional staged progression and random effect pools.

Default config includes non-lethal confusion/nausea overdose behavior for cannabis variants while preserving lethal behavior pathways for other drugs depending on configuration.

---

## Achievement System

Drug milestones appear in the Drugs tab of Minecraft’s native Advancements screen, with vanilla unlock toasts and server-managed progress. Existing YAML unlocks and connoisseur tracking migrate when players join. Configuration is split into:

- `achievement_settings.yml` (system toggles + notifications + quick defaults)
- `achievements.yml` (trigger definitions and custom achievements)

The `notifications.chat_message` setting controls vanilla chat announcements, and `notifications.sound` controls native unlock toasts (including their sound). Legacy fireworks and unlock prefixes are no longer used.

Supported trigger styles include first use, all drugs used, max tolerance behavior, crafting-based triggers, use-count triggers, and overdose outcomes.

---

## PlaceholderAPI Support

If PlaceholderAPI is installed, this plugin registers `%drugs_...%` placeholders:

- `%drugs_<drugid>%` → current tolerance
- `%drugs_<drugid>_max%` → max tolerance
- `%drugs_<drugid>_effectiveness%` → potency percentage

---

## Growing crafting ingredients

Drug recipes require custom harvested ingredients. Ordinary flowers, minerals, vines,
ferns, and planting stock cannot substitute for a harvest, including in automatic crafters.
Existing `recipes.yml` files receive the requirement at registration, without being overwritten.
Use `/drugs growing` for instructions or click a drug in `/drugs` to view its current recipe.

Craft one crop seed by combining wheat seeds with the starter below (shapeless).
Right click hydrated farmland to plant. Crops use distinct plant blocks configured by `plant-block` in `growing.yml`. Right-click empty-handed to see a progress bar, percentage, remaining active growth time, and any paused conditions. Existing wheat crops convert automatically in loaded chunks; growth pauses in unloaded chunks, dry soil, or light below 9.
Break a fully mature crop to receive two harvested ingredients and one reusable seed.
Breaking early returns only its seed. Bone meal cannot skip growing.

| Crop | Starter | Used for | Default growth time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Poppy | Poppy | Heroin, fent | 10 minutes |
| Mushroom | Red mushroom | Shrooms | 8 minutes |
| Ephedra | Quartz | Meth | 15 minutes |
| Coca | Vine | Cocaine | 15 minutes |
| Sassafras | Magenta dye | Molly | 15 minutes |
| Ergot | Spore blossom | LSD | 20 minutes |
| Salvia | Lilac | Salvia | 10 minutes |
| Resin | Bone meal | Glue | 10 minutes |

Cannabis uses the existing fern growing system: plant a fern, wait for a large fern,
and harvest with shears. Mature plants yield two Cannabis Buds plus strain planting
stock. Joint, blunt, edible, cart, and CBD recipes require buds, and bongs accept buds.
Strain inheritance and mutations remain supported. Farm workers replant planting stock
and deliver the harvested buds at their controller.

Ingredient crop progress is saved in `ingredient_plants.yml` on planting, harvesting,
every minute, and shutdown. Configure crop durations in `growing.yml`; `/drugs reload`
applies changes. Cannabis uses the same saved growth timer, percentage readout, water/light checks, and farm worker path as other crops. Set `cannabis.growth-seconds` in `growing.yml` (600 seconds by default). The old mechanics setting is a fallback when the new setting is absent. Existing cannabis plants retain their strains; legacy immature plants start their timed growth when loaded, while mature plants stay ready to harvest.
Finished items remain available through the existing admin give command.

## Cartel NPC Buyers

Install **Citizens** (a build compatible with your Minecraft server), **Vault**, and an economy provider such as **EssentialsX Economy**, then restart the server. Cartel buyers and enforcers are player NPCs with a bundled camouflage-style cartel skin. Other drug features work without Citizens; cartel NPCs require it.

- `/cartel create` — spawn a stationary, protected player NPC buyer at your position.
- `/cartel remove` — remove the buyer you are looking at within five blocks.
- `/cartel reload` — reload prices from `plugins/LumiDrugs/cartel.yml`.

Players **throw drug items within two blocks of the buyer** to sell the dropped stack. Right-clicking the buyer explains how to deliver; there is no selling menu. Buyers persist in Citizens' NPC storage across restarts. Existing villager buyers migrate at their original locations when their chunks load with Citizens enabled. Players must remain near the buyer to sell.

Review the example unit prices in `cartel.yml` before opening sales. Missing, zero, negative, or non-finite prices disable a drug's sales. Optional `strain-prices.<drug>.<strain>` entries override its base unit price. Only registered drug items carrying the plugin's metadata are accepted; renamed vanilla items, planting stock, and partially used cartridges are rejected. Cartridges have no default sale price. Failed economy deposits leave the dropped items untouched on the ground. Only genuine player drops are accepted; tracked drops cannot merge with other stacks, preserving the seller attribution.

Permissions: `drugs.cartel.sell` defaults to everyone; `drugs.cartel.admin` defaults to operators. NPC creation requires Citizens. Keep its NPC data when backing up the server. Daily limits and bulk delivery bonuses are not part of this version.

### Roaming cartel enforcers

Cartel enforcers can spawn on nearby walkable ground, walk toward a survival/adventure player, and demand a specific drug quantity. Each encounter chooses a **random priced drug and a random quantity (8–32 by default)**, with a 90-second deadline. The timer begins when the enforcer gets close enough to speak, with warnings every 15 seconds. Throw the requested drug within two blocks of your enforcer to deliver it at the configured cartel prices, including strain price overrides. Smaller deliveries accumulate toward the demand and are paid as accepted. Excess items remain on the ground; wrong drugs and other players' drops do not count. Partial deliveries already sold remain paid even if the encounter later expires or is called off. Ordinary buyer sales do not count toward this demand.

Use `/cartel enforcer` to test a random demand on yourself, or `/cartel enforcer <player> <drug> <amount>` to choose the player, registered drug ID, and quantity. Both commands require `drugs.cartel.admin`. Manual encounters ignore the player's cooldown and the automatic-spawning toggle, but still require an eligible player, working economy, positive base price, safe spawn location, and no existing encounter for that player.

Configure the `enforcer` section in `cartel.yml`, then run `/cartel reload`. Automatic checks default to every 300 seconds, with a 25% chance per eligible player, a 30-minute per-player cooldown after each encounter, and at most eight active NPCs. `min-amount` and `max-amount` set the inclusive random quantity range (clamped to 1–2304). Drugs are chosen uniformly from registered drugs with positive, finite base prices; missing or disabled prices exclude them. The chosen drug and quantity stay fixed for that encounter. Legacy `enforcer.drug` and `enforcer.amount` entries are ignored. Explicit admin commands still accept a chosen drug and quantity. Set `enabled: false` to disable automatic encounters. Existing config files use the same defaults when the section is missing; copy the `enforcer` section from the bundled [cartel.yml](src/main/resources/cartel.yml) to expose all settings.

Each expired demand adds one consecutive refusal for that player. At **15 refusals**, the enforcer uses angrier dialogue and caps new delivery deadlines at **45 seconds**; at **20**, he becomes furious and caps them at **30 seconds**. Completing a demand resets the streak; partial deliveries do not. Called-off encounters neither add to nor reset it. Streaks persist in player data across reconnects and server restarts. Configure thresholds and deadline caps under `enforcer.aggravation`, and dialogue with the `angry-*` / `furious-*` keys under `enforcer.messages`. `{refusals}` shows the current streak.

Use `{remaining}` in warnings for the quantity still needed. Customize the arrival, demand, warning, failure, and success dialogue under `enforcer.messages`. Failure produces threats only by default. Optional `failure-damage` is measured in HP, applies only within six blocks, and is capped at 20 HP and the player's health minus one before normal damage events/modifiers. Set it to `0` for dialogue only. Grant `drugs.cartel.enforcer.bypass` to exempt a player (not granted to operators automatically).

Enforcers use Citizens player NPCs and navigation. They cancel without a penalty if they cannot reach the player before the approach timeout, the player dies/disconnects/travels to another world or far away, or the economy becomes unavailable. Reloading cartel settings calls off active demands. NPCs also clean up on chunk unload and plugin shutdown; enforcers and cooldowns are temporary and reset on server restart. Stationary cartel buyers remain persistent.

### Cartel NPC skins

Both buyers and enforcers use the bundled signed camouflage-style skin by default (a snapshot of the public Minecraft skin for `ElChapo`). It does not require a skin lookup at spawn. To use another Minecraft account's skin, add this to `cartel.yml` and run `/cartel reload`:

```yaml
npc:
  skin-name: "MinecraftUsername"
```

Leave `skin-name` blank to restore the bundled skin. Reload updates existing buyers and calls off active enforcer demands; subsequent enforcers use the updated skin. Username-based skins require Citizens to fetch the account's skin from Mojang.

If `/cartel enforcer` cannot start, its error identifies the failed requirement: player mode/permissions, an existing encounter, pricing, economy, NPC provider, safe ground, or NPC spawning. For a Citizens spawn failure, check the console for the associated spawn rejection or exception. Enforcers now attempt navigation without rejecting a new NPC on Citizens' preliminary path check; unreachable players are handled by the approach timeout.

Farm data now saves to `farms.yml`; existing `weed_farms.yml` is read automatically when the new file is absent. Legacy `weed-farm` mechanics settings remain supported when no `farm` section exists.

## Java source layout

Production code lives in `src/main/java/com/drugs`, grouped by feature: `farm`, `growing`, `strains`, `bong`, `cartel`, `drug`, `items`, `recipes`, `addiction`, `tolerance`, `overdose`, `effects`, `achievements`, `status`, `commands`, `ui`, `config`, `integration`, and `bootstrap`. Tests mirror these packages under `src/test/java/com/drugs`. `DrugsV2` remains at the root as the plugin entry point.

## Reusable NPC following library

Cartel enforcer movement is implemented by the independent [LumiFollow](lumifollow/README.md)
Maven library. It includes Citizens following, sprinting, doors, wall climbing, drop assists,
and teleport recovery, and can be shaded into quest plugins or other Citizens integrations.
LumiDrugs bundles its own relocated copy; no additional server plugin is needed.

Build both modules with Java 21 using `mvn clean install` from this repository's root.
The plugin JAR is now at `lumidrugs/target/LumiDrugs.jar`; the reusable library JAR is at
`lumifollow/target/lumifollow-1.0.0.jar`. The library README contains dependency and usage examples.
